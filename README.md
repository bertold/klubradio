# Klubradio

This repo is setup to

* pull the last feed of "A lényeg" show from [KLub Rádió](https://www.klubradio.hu) on a daily basis, and to
* update a [feed JSON file](klubradio.json) with the link to the latest show.

This is required to provide a single-item JSON file for an [Amazon Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/). The skill is currently under review.

Note that this repository does not copy anything from Klub Rádió, it merely constructs a URL to the show MP3 file hosted by the station itself.
